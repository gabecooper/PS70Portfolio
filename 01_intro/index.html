<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are at most 3 ideas for my final project
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1: A sole insert that measures gait</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>
I've heard each persons gait is as identifiable as their fingerprints. Given that, it would be exciting to be able to 
get real measurements about peoples gait baseline and even identify them based off the data. I wonder if it shows anything else... really any wearables are epic.

<h4>Idea 2: A really engaging Likert Scale in real life. Or really any kinetic sculpture. Real life wordle?</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

People hate taking surveys. Elderly folks don't always enjoy using their devices. A functional Likert Scale that could reset itself and store 
the information would be a fun step up from those usual smiley buttons that are at airports.

<h4>Idea 3: BCI x LLM integration</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

A binary BCI switch that operates such that an LLM offers a descion (e.g. should we code a producitvity app or a game?) and then 
is told via my brain activity what descion to take. 
<br> Also rings such that gesture motions work too may be a fun project.
