<h3>Hey there! Thanks for coming to my site.</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
I absolutely love playing board games, Spikeball, and running. &nbsp; While I intend to study neuroscience, I'm also interested
in CS and economics. In my free time, I've built some pretty bizarre passion projects I'd be eager to tell you more about. &nbsp;Ask me about the
dog arcade machine, mini-golf course, or escape room! :) <br> <br> I also love reading (Ready Player One, Outliers, and Red-Rising are among
my favorite books), hanging with my dog, and playing soccer with friends. &nbsp;And finally, I think it'd be really, really cool to be able
to backflip... <br> <br> </bar>  <p class = "margin"></p>
